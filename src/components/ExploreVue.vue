  <h4>Now that you are up and running...</h4>
  <p>
    Take some time to look at the folders and files, just to get a feel for how
    things are structured. Some things I like to check out are:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>package.json</li>
    <li>src Folder</li>
    <li>components Folder</li>
    <li>src/App.vue and src/components/HelloWorld.vue</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    You can find the dependencies and scripts for your app in the package.json
    file. In the src folder you will find your App.vue file and the components
    folder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a look at your App.vue file. Everything you put on your app will come
    through here. It is the final structure to which you will add compnents.
  </p>
  <p>
    The components are each Vue files, which contain HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
